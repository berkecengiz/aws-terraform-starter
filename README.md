# AWS Terraform Starter

This is a simple Terraform starter project to provision an S3 bucket on AWS.

## 🛠️ What It Does

- Creates a private S3 bucket
- Uses a random suffix to ensure uniqueness
- Outputs the created bucket name

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## ⚠️ Cost Management

This demo only provisions an S3 bucket (minimal cost), but always check your AWS billing dashboard after testing.

## 🔄 Clean Up

```bash
terraform destroy
```
